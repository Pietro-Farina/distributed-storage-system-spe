Sequential Consistency Checker for Distributed Storage System

This checker validates Sequential Consistency (SC), NOT Linearizability.

Key difference:
- Linearizability: Must respect real-time ordering (timestamps)
- Sequential Consistency: Only requires a valid total ordering that preserves
  per-client program order, regardless of wall-clock time

Example: If client A writes x=1 at t=1.0 and client B reads x=0 at t=2.0,
  Linearizability: VIOLATION (B must see A's write)
  Sequential Consistency: OK (can order as: Read-B → Write-A)

Checks performed:
1. Read-your-writes: Each client must see its own writes
2. Monotonic reads: Same client can't see older versions after newer ones
3. No impossible reads: Can't read versions that were never written
4. Version consistency: No missing version numbers (lost updates)
